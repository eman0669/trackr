# Trackr

Trackr is a personal tracking mobile app built to help manage **calories, workouts, and budget** in one place.  
The goal is to create a simple, flexible tracker that focuses on daily awareness instead of overwhelming features.

This project is built primarily for personal use, learning, and long-term iteration.

## Why Trackr?
Most existing apps focus on only one area such as calorie tracking, gym workouts, or finance. Trackr aims to:
- Combine calories in, calories out, and spending in a single app
- Support flexible daily targets such as zigzag calorie schedules
- Use AI to help estimate calories instead of relying on rigid food databases
- Stay simple, fast, and practical for everyday use
